      Hello!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hi, we are a couple of students working on a compilation of useful stuff to help lost students like us find their way through the terrifyingly boring journey that school can be. We know starting a new school year, or paddling through it, can be a very stressful ordeal but do not fear, as we have put together an essential survival guide to get you through those nervous everlasting days.
      <br>
      In this webpage you'll find printables you can use to organize yourself (or to at least try to), that can be used by anybody and everybody. We will also provide our own tips and tricks to ease and help you on your journey. We'll also make notes and links to every useful school related websites and information, and will attach useful summaries that we've used in school.
      <br>
      This project was made to insipire everyone to try being a good student, which is why most of it will provide a mostly aesthetic content to motivate, as it motivates us, and trick us into thinking school doesn't suck that much. </p>
