<h3>Biology:</h3>
<p>
  For doing well in biology you have to know everything we learned by heart, study hard, bring interesting things to score points for the classwork and raise your hand to add many points also for the classwork.
</p>

<h3>Maths:</h3>
<p>
  For doing well in maths, if you do not understand something ask the teacher what you do not understand and do the exercises that the teacher gives you.
  Pay attention in class not to have to study much in your home, since you understand the topic because you paid attention to the teacher.
  If you missed a day or several days to class, ask your classmates what they did so you do not miss any topic.Review for the tests with your friends, even if you think you already know it.
