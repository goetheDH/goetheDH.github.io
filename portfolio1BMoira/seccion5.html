  <h1 align="center">Why we like it?</h1>

<p>
  We like to play sports because we are outdoors with our friends, you train, it's good for your health and it's fun.
</p>
<h3>Why do we think it's good to play sports?</h3>

<p>
  We think it's good to play sports, because:
Sport is a regulated activity, usually of a competitive nature, that can improve the physical condition of those who practice it, and it also has properties that differentiate it from the game.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>it does good to health.</li>
  <li>you train.</li>
  <li>Tou have something to do (you do not get bored).</li>
</ul>
